Fleeting Dream Recorder
=======================

"Voicemail for Dreamers"

Google Play Store Link - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.lapasa.fleetingdreamrecorder

Set your alarm to wake up the next day. When the alarm goes off, you will be prompted to speak into your device's microphone and attempt to recall as many details about your dream as possible.

Think of the app as leaving a voice mail to yourself. Listen to a playlist of your dream recordings in reality. Over the course of time, you might discover a common occurrence or a pattern.

Prior to going to sleep, you might be able to program your mind to continue dreaming where you last left off if you can hear all the details from the last dream
